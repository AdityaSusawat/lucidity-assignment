# Lucidity frontend assignment

A basic inventory management system.

**Tech Used:** React, javaScript, Tailwind

✔ All features working
✔ UI almost identical to the one in assignment
✔ Added a loading and an error state for product fetching (`./SS/5.jpeg` & `./SS/6.jpeg`)
❗ I considered implementing Redux for state management, but realized it after much of the development was already completed.
❌ Could not deploy it for now, please find screenshots attached in the folder named `SS`

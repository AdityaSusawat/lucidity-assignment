# Lucidity frontend assignment

A basic inventory management system.

**Tech Used:** React, javaScript, Tailwind

<ul>
    <li>✔ All features working</li>
    <li>✔ UI almost identical to the one in assignment</li>
    <li>✔ Added a loading and an error state for product fetching (`./SS/5.jpeg` & `./SS/6.jpeg`)</li>
    <li>❗ I considered implementing Redux for state management, but realized it after much of the development was already completed.</li>
    <li>❌ Could not deploy it for now, please find screenshots attached in the folder named `SS`</li>
</ul>
